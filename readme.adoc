You need Apache Derby 10.14.2.0 and Payara 5.2022.3 installed,
along with their $HOME environment variables.

Make sure you set SDK to java 11.0.17 in project settings.
Build project using "mvn clean package" command.
If it does not work in the terminal, try intellij.

In the .idea directory there are runConfigurations for deployment of
Apache network server and Payara server. Load & start it first.

Set up connection to remote Apache Derby database. URL: +
jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/WM;create=true +
 Next initialize database with static structures from createDB.sql script
and populate them with initDB.sql values.

There is also maven exec plugin configured for automatic deployment of database resources (connection pool and JNDI). It needs to be executed after first deployment of Payara server.

The last step is to configure the Security realm according to project instructions.
