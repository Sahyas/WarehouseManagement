You need Apache Derby 10.14.2.0 and Payara 5.2022.3 installed,
along with their $DERBY_HOME and $PAYARA_HOME environment variables - to their home catalogues.

Make sure you set SDK to java 11.0.17 Amazon Corretto in project settings.
Build project using "mvn clean package" command. Use intellij lifecycles, for proper java version.

In the .idea directory there are runConfigurations for deployment of
Apache network server and Payara server. Load & start "startNetworkServer" first.

Set up connection to remote Apache Derby database. URL: +
jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/WM;create=true +
Next initialize database with static structures from createDB.sql script
and populate them with initDB.sql values.

Next run second prepared configuration for deploying Payara server.

There is also maven exec plugin configured for automatic deployment of database resources (connection pool and JNDI). +
It needs to be executed after first deployment of Payara server.

The last step is to configure the Security realm according to project instructions.
